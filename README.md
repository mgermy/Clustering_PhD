# Clustering_PhD

Here you will find two code examples that I used while working with clustering analysis. The codes are simple, but give a general idea about how the methodology was applied. 

1 - piecewise_linear.py: this code first creates a variable reduction in the data of vertical temperature. Due to the size of the dataset, I had to parallelize the code.

2 - elbow-cluster.py: first visualizes the ideal number of clusters then I apply k-means clustering in the dataset. At the end, I export the clusters tags as a CSV file.
